# Recipe DSL

A repository containing the evolving source code and supporting materials for work on a **domain-specific language (DSL) for recipes**. The project explores how to formally represent cooking processes as structured graphs of ingredients, actions, environments, and constraints. The goal is to create a solid, extensible framework that supports both rigorous analysis (e.g. provenance, reproducibility, reasoning) and practical applications (e.g. execution engines, comparisons between recipes, educational tools).


## Milestones

A dependency graph of milestones serving as a rationale behind the development and eventual application of a formal cooking recipe DSL.
